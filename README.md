This is the official repository for our paper, [𝛿-Stance: A Large-Scale Real World Dataset of Stances in Legal Argumentation](https://bit.ly/43CJfCr). 𝛿-Stance is a dataset of stances involved in legal argumentation, providing stance-annotated argument pairs, semi-automatically mined from millions of examples of U.S. judges citing precedent in context using citation signals. 

This repository contains code for curating stance-annotated tuples, provides the associated dataset and the modeling experiments based on 𝛿-Stance.
